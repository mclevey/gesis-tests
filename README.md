# GESIS Testing

## Setup

1. Sign up for a free Github account
2. Fork the course materials repository
3. Start a new codespace
4. Run `bash setup.sh`
5. Run `source ~/.bashrc`
6. Run `poetry install`

Hang tight, it will take some time to do the installations. When it finishes and you see a line like this:

you're ready to go!
